# EventsDO
Event booking app, using MERN stacks and GraphQL API, project learned from Academind.

In this project, GraphQL was used to reduce the end points as compared to REST API, however they do have their own stands in different aspects. GraphQL would just require one POST request to be sent to, but writing queries and setting up the build schema could be quite challenging at first. On the other hand, when the project starts to get more complexed, REST API could end up with an enormous amount of end points.
